# Lab-Essential-Toolkit
Some essential program fragments for labwork: extracting, manipulating and plotting. Save yourself some drudgery and learn the UNIX(TM)-like workflow, available to you on most FEPS computers and possibly your own device.

NB:
These programs aren't meant to be 'correct' or even good, but simple and demonstrative - a launching point for further endeavors on the part of the individual, minimally sufficient. So yes, I know you aren't supposed to use cat and echo like that, but they outline the program flow nicely.
