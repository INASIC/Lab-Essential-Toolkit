# Lab-Essential-Toolkit
Some essential program fragments for labwork: extracting, manipulating and plotting. Save yourself some drudgery and learn the UNIX(TM)-like workflow, available to you on most FEPS computers and possibly your own device; they should work on most linuxen.

Outline:
  * extract.sh: a shell script for extracting data from arbitrary formatted text files
  * math.sh: a shell script for manipulating column-formatted text files
  * genplot.gnu: a nifty gnuplot mini-library for generating gnuplot commands from inside gnuplot
  * example.gnu: a gnuplot script that uses genplot.gnu to stop copy-paste coding dead in its tracks.

NB:
These programs aren't meant to be 'correct' or even good, but simple and demonstrative - a launching point for further endeavors on the part of the individual, minimally sufficient. So yes, I know you aren't supposed to use cat and echo like that, but they outline the program flow nicely.
